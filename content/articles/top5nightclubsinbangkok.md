# The Club Khaosan

Best Night Club in BangkokA lot of expats don’t like Khaosan because they think it’s too touristy and full of young and drunk backpackers. However the truth is, unlike in most places in downtown Bangkok, Khaosan is still the best area to meet young Thai girls for absolutely free one night stands. Especially student girls and young office workers like to come here to meet foreigners who are on holiday mode. Gulliver’s on the northern end of the road was my long time favorite, but unfortunately they just recently closed. The best nightclub in Khaosan is simply called “The Club” located halfway down the strip. You can’t miss it with its huge blue neon lights. It usually gets busy well before midnight (even on weekdays). There are a few tables around but people rather come here to drink, dance and meet on the big dance floor.

Entrance Fee: 150-200 Baht including 1 drink
